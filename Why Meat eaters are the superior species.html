<title> Why meat eaters are superior </title>
<h1> Why Meat eaters are better</hl>
<p>Fact: Male meat eaters automatically grow a beard right when puberty hits. Weak veggie eaters have to wait until they are fifty.
Fact: Meats eaters get their energy and protien from meat. Which makes us stronger to tackle day to day activites like weight lighting and bear wrestling 
      Veggie eaters have to get their protien from powder and soy... YUCK.
	  Fact: Meat eaters don't make veggie eaters feel guilty for eating our meats food why should veggie eaters make us feel guilty for eating our HEALTHY protien!</font>
